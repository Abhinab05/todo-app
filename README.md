So basically, I made a simple To-Do list app in Python with 4 different choices.
1. When I add a task, it takes my input and saves it in a text file using the open() function in append mode.
2. For viewing tasks, it reads the file line by line and shows each task with a number, so it's easy to see the list properly.
3. The delete part is simple too. It shows all the tasks with numbers, I just enter the number I want to delete, and it updates the file by removing that one.
4. There is an option to exit the app anytime.# todo-app
